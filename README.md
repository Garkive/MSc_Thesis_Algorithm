Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) algorithm with Simulated Annealing acceptance criteria
to solve the VRPPD with multiple depots, time windows, capacitated and with heterogenous fleet.
It deals with a specific case from a real world distribution company as well as the Li & Lim benchmarks.

Modules DestroyOps.py and RepairOps.py contain the main heuristics as well as the required support
functions. OperatorSelection.py contains all weight and score update functions as well as
function to select heuristics. AcceptanceCriteria.py contains a simple Simulated Annealing 
acceptance function.

Folders HFVRP_Version and Dynamic_Version contain the Heterogenous Fleet and Dynamic versions, respectively, of the developed code.
