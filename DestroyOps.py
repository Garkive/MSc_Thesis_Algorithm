#Destroy operators development to be used in the ALNS framework

#Input - Initial Solution
#Output - Destroyed Solution without some requests

#These requests will subsequently be submit to a repair operator where they will
#be reintroduced in the solution

#Operators initially considered:
    #1 - Shaw Removal or Related Removal
    #2 - Worst Removal
    #3 - Random Removal 
    #4 - Route Removal
    
#A parameter q will determine the "degree of destruction" desired, this may be 
#a fixed value or fluctuating, depending on the desired algorithm behaviour.

#Higher values promote diversity but may never converge to a good solution. 
#Lower values reduces diversification by reducing the search space.

#The value that q takes is between 0 and 1, representing the percentage of the 
#destroyed in each iteration.
